    <h2>Game Concept</h2>
    <p>Jason is in his bedroom, playing a game with his teddy bear Hope. He and Hope are fighting the shadow demons that lurk on the walls and on the ceiling. An intense demon-fighting session leaves Jason hungry, so he goes downstairs to check if dinner is ready. On the way, he hears his parents fighting. When he enters the kitchen, they redirect their anger to Jason and in their rage, send him back to his room so they don't have to look at him. Hope seems to prompt Jason to go on an adventure, so they exit through the "portal" along with a torch. He climbs down with Jason to reach the ground below, and they set off, following the footpath to the forest close by. Along the way, they are attacked by a shadow monster, which they fend off using the torch.<br><br>

    Upon reaching the forest, Jason wanders to his usual spot, checking the lock on the old maze as is tradition. "Still locked," he complains. He notices the wooden sword his grandparents gave him as a gift years ago. "I think I'm gonna need this today." He grips the sword tightly in his right hand. As he turns around to continue something glowing catches his eye. He walks over, naturally curious, and discovers that it is a box. It appears to speak to him. "Open me," it says. "Everything you need to solve your problems is in here." Jason is reluctant but eventually agrees to open the box after thinking back to how he felt earlier on in the day. Immediately a swarm of demons exits the box into the world. The sky above turns a dark shade of red. A demon resembling a young girl waits and taunts Jason. "You idiot, look what you've done! I'm in Despair. I'm everything that makes you miserable. You'll never be able to trap us back inside. We are your worst nightmare. Only happiness can destroy us, and you don't even remember how that feels." She flies away, cackling.<br><br>

    Nervous but brave, Jason takes the box and brings it home. On his way out of the forest, he is attacked by terrifyingly huge spiders. He slays them all with the wooden sword. "Good thing we took this," he says to Hope. Making his way home he thinks about what the demon said. "Only happiness can destroy us." Jason decides that he needs to save the world, so he thinks back to his happiest memories. He comes to the conclusion that he must put items that represent these memories into the box. A small sacrifice to save the world.<br></p>

    <p>Puzzle level 1 takes place in Jason's home. He must find the first item to put into the box. Having figured out what the box needs, Jason searches his house for the first item. He finds his favourite blanket and realises it can be used as a parachute in case of emergency. After searching for a while he recalls his parents telling him not to go into the basement, so he decides eventually that this is the most likely place something so important would be. As he opens the door to go down the stairs, the floor falls beneath him and Jason starts falling. Using the blanket as a parachute, he is able to avoid obstacles and land safely on the basement floor. An eerie basement setting with a couple of jumpscares leads Jason to the first item, his favourite tshirt from when he was younger. He's grateful his parents kept it, even if it was in a musty old box in the basement.<br><br>

    Puzzle level 2 is a house of mirrors. After finding the first item, Despair returns to taunt Jason. She guides him to the picture of him and his parents at the theme park above his desk, and turns it into a portal to the house of mirrors that he always loved. She tells him to go in and "try this one out for size". It is a mirror puzzle, where Jason must redirect the light to the correct spots in order to reveal the path to the correct spot. After doing so, he solves a riddle and wins a toy from a claw machine. This is the second item.<br><br>

    Puzzle level 3 takes place in the labyrinth in the forest. Despair appears again, clearly angry that Jason made it out of the house of mirrors. She unlocks the gate for him and tells him he'll get lost forever. Of course, with the help of Hope, a flashlight and a trusty wooden sword, Jason defeats any monsters lurking within and finds the center of the maze. It reveals the third item he needs, a football that he lost some time ago when he was playing with his cousins who never seem to visit anymore. While he's grateful to have the ball back, he knows it must be used to save the world.</p>
